abstract = {Sophisticated models of human social behavior are fast becoming highly desirable in an increasingly complex and interrelated world. Here, we propose that rather than taking established theories from the physical sciences and naively mapping them into the social world, the advanced concepts and theories of social psychology should be taken as a starting point, and used to develop a new modeling methodology. In order to illustrate how such an approach might be carried out, we attempt to model the low elaboration attitude changes of a society of agents in an evolving social context. We propose a geometric model of an agent in context, where individual agent attitudes are seen to self-organize to form ideologies, which then serve to guide further agent-based attitude changes. A computational implementation of the model is shown to exhibit a number of interesting phenomena, including a tendency for a measure of the entropy in the system to decrease, and a potential for externally guiding a population of agents toward a new desired ideology.},

abstract = {In this review, a number of experimental findings and theoretical concepts that have led to new insights into the mechanisms underlying brain waves are presented. At the cellular level, the new evidence that certain types of neuron have intrinsic oscillatory properties that may underlie rhythmic EEG activities is discussed. In particular, the question of whether spindle oscillations are autonomous or input-dependent is addressed. At the neural network level, the main circuits of the thalamus and cortex that are responsible for the occurrence and modulation of spindles and alpha activity are described. In addition, the properties of rhythmic activities outside the alpha band are considered, particularly in relation to the prominent beta activity of the visual cortex. At the theoretical level, the possibility that neural networks may behave as complex dynamic systems with the properties of deterministic chaos is discussed. Finally, the fact that brain rhythms may have functional implications for the working of neural networks is examined in relation to 2 cases: the possibility that oscillations may subserve a gating function, and that oscillations may play a role in the formation of assemblies of neurons that represent given stimulus patterns.},

abstract = {Good design is not free of form. It does not necessarily happen through a mere sampling of technologies packaged together, through pure analysis, or just by following procedures. Good design begins with inspiration and a vision, a mental image of the end product, which can sometimes be described with a design metaphor. A successful example from the 20th century is the desktop metaphor, which took a real desktop as an orientation for the manipulation of electronic documents on a computer. Initially defined by Xerox, then refined by Apple and others, it could be found on almost every computer by the turn of the 20th century. This paper sketches a specific metaphor for the emerging field of highly automated vehicles, their interactions with human users and with other vehicles. In the introduction, general questions on vehicle automation are raised and related to the physical control of conventional vehicles and to the automation of some late 20th century vehicles. After some words on design metaphors, the H-Metaphor is introduced. More details of the metaphor's source are described and their application to human-machine interaction, automation and management of intelligent vehicles sketched. Finally, risks and opportunities to apply the metaphor to technical applications are discussed.},

The operators in each group are commuting but operators of different groups are not. The second qubit represents Jung's two perspectives of extraversion and introversion. It is shown that this system gives a natural explanation of the 16 psychological types that are defined in the Jungian tradition. Further, the system accounts for the restriction posed by Jung concerning the possible combination of psychological functions and perspectives. The empirical consequences of the present theory are discussed, and the results of a pilot study are reported with the aim to check some basic predictions of the theory. In addition, it is shown why the present praxis of personality diagnostics based on classical statistics is insufficient.},

Recent studies on emotional processing have implicated differing brain regions for different emotions, but little has been determined on the timing of this processing. Here we presented a large number of unfamiliar faces expressing the six basic emotions, plus neutral faces, to 26 young adults while recording event-related potentials (ERPs). Subjects were naive with respect to the specific questions investigated; it was an implicit emotional task. ERPs showed global effects of emotion from 90 ms (P1), while latency and amplitude differences among emotional expressions were seen from 140 ms (N170 component). Positive emotions evoked N170 significantly earlier than negative emotions and the amplitude of N170 evoked by fearful faces was larger than neutral or surprised faces. At longer latencies (330–420 ms) at fronto-central sites, we also found a different pattern of effects among emotions. Localization analyses confirmed the superior and middle-temporal regions for early processing of facial expressions; the negative emotions elicited later, distinctive activations. The data support a model of automatic, rapid processing of emotional expressions.},

abstract = {To study the mechanisms of chronic neurogenic pain, we compared the power spectra of the resting EEG of patients (n = 15, 38–75 years, median 64 years, 6 women) and healthy controls (n = 15, 41–71 years, median 60 years, 8 women). On an average, the patient group exhibited higher spectral power over the frequency range of 2–25 Hz, and the dominant peak was shifted towards lower frequencies. Maximal differences appeared in the 7–9 Hz band in all electrodes. Frontal electrodes contributed most to this difference in the 13–15 Hz band. Bicoherence analysis suggests an enhanced coupling between theta (4–9 Hz) and beta (12–25 Hz) frequencies in patients. The subgroup of six patients free from centrally acting medication showed higher spectral power in the 2–18 Hz frequency range. On an individual basis, the combination of peak height and peak frequency discriminated between patient and control groups: discriminant analysis classified 87{\%} of all subjects correctly. After a therapeutic lesion in the thalamus (central lateral thalamotomy, CLT) we carried out follow-up for a subgroup of seven patients. Median pain relief was 70 and 95{\%} after 3 and 12 months, respectively. The average EEG power of all seven patients gradually decreased in the theta band and approached normal values only after 12 months. The excess theta EEG power in patients and its decrease after thalamic surgery suggests that both EEG and neurogenic pain are determined by tightly coupled thalamocortical loops. The small therapeutic CLT lesion is thought to initiate a progressive normalization in the affected thalamocortical system, which is reflected in both decrease of EEG power and pain relief.},

It is predicted that automated vehicles, especially those capable of “driving themselves”, will improve road safety and provide a range of other transport and societal benefits. A fundamental issue, from a human factors perspective, is how to design automation so that drivers understand fully the capabilities and limitations of the vehicle, and maintain situational awareness of what the vehicle is doing and when manual intervention is needed – especially for first generation vehicles that require drivers to resume manual control of automated functions when the vehicle is incapable of controlling itself. The purpose of this paper is to document some of the human factors challenges associated with the transition from manually driven to self-driving vehicles, and to outline what we can be doing in Australia, through research and other means, to address them.},

@article{Kaufman1992,
abstract = {The magnetoencephalogram (MEG) was used to detect regional changes in spontaneous cortical activity accompanying short-term memory search. This method was chosen because magnetic fields are detectable only within a few centimeters of the projections of their sources onto the scalp. The specific hypothesis that auditory cortex is involved in scanning memory for tones was tested by sensing the field of the magnetic counterpart to N100 (N100m) which is known to originate in auditory cortex. N100m was measured at many different positions and the spontaneous cortical rhythms in the alpha bandwidth (8–12 Hz) were measured at the same places. These rhythms were found to be suppressed while subjects scanned memory for musical tones in a Sternberg paradigm. For 3 subjects, both the MEG suppression time (ST) and reaction time (RT) increased linearly with memory set size. The correlation between ST measured over the left hemisphere and set size was significant for two subjects but not significant for the third, and the slopes of the regression lines relating ST to set size were too shallow to be related to the time required to scan memory. However, the correlation between ST of the right hemisphere and set size was highly significant for all subjects, and the slopes of the regression lines were comparable to those relating RT to set size. The electroencephalogram (EEG) recorded with midline electrodes failed to reveal a significant relationship between suppression time and set size for 2 of the subjects, thus ruling out global alpha blockage and generalized arousal as the basis for the task-related suppression duration. The electric N100, measured at Cz, decreased significantly in amplitude with set size for 2 subjects, but in increased significantly in amplitude for the third subject. In contrast, RT increased with set size for all subjects. N100m measured over the right hemisphere was similar to the behavior of N100, while N100m measured over the left hemisphere showed little change in amplitude with set size, thus establishing an asymmetry in N100 between the hemispheres. Since N100 amplitude is normally larger when attention is paid to auditory stimuli, differential attention alone cannot account for the relation between ST and set size. Furthermore, the processing negativity, which may be superimposed on N100 in selective attention tasks, was not discernible for any set size. It was also found that ST prior to the button press was not correlated with RT. Hence, the covariation of set size with ST is not attributable to preparation for a motor response. In this experiment the sensors were placed where the field of N100m was approximately at its maximum value. Since many measures were made from somewhat different positions in these areas, it was possible to determine how N100m amplitude varied with sensor location over both hemispheres. These position-dependent changes in N100m amplitude were significantly correlated with corresponding position-dependent changes in percent suppression of the spontaneous MEG. Thus, auditory cortex contributes significantly to the spontaneous alpha activity suppressed during memory search. It is concluded that regional changes in cortical spontaneous activity are meaningfully related to ongoing memory scanning. Earlier work on the relation between short-term memory and the N100 and P300 ERP components is reviewed in an Appendix. It is concluded that published conjectures on the relation between N100 and short-term memory are inconclusive, and neither P300 latency nor amplitude have been convincingly related to short-term memory scanning per se. These ERP components are complementary to the regional changes in spontaneous activity studied here, and reflect different facets of the processes involved in memory scanning.},

abstract = {The current cognitive engineering literature includes a broad range of models of human-automation interaction (HAI) in complex systems. Some of these models characterize types and levels of automation (LOAs) and relate different LOAs to implications for human performance , workload, and situation awareness as bases for systems design. However, some have suggested that the LOAs approach has overlooked key issues that need to be considered during the design process. Others are simply unsatisfied with the current state of the art in modeling HAI. In this paper, I argue that abandoning an existing framework with some utility for design makes little sense unless the cognitive engineering community can provide the broader design community with other sound alternatives. On this basis, I summarize issues with existing definitions of LOAs, including (a) presumptions of human behavior with automation and (b) imprecision in defining behavioral constructs for assessment of automation. I propose steps for advances in LOA frameworks. I provide evidence of the need for precision in defining behavior in use of automation as well as a need for descriptive models of human performance with LOAs. I also provide a survey of other classes of HAI models, offering insights into ways to achieve descriptive formulations of tax-onomies of LOAs to support conceptual and detailed systems design. The ultimate objective of this line of research is reliable models for predicting human and system performance to serve as a basis for design.},

abstract = {Evidence is presented that EEG oscillations in the alpha and theta band reflect cognitive and memory performance in particular. Good {\v{Z}}. {\v{Z}}. performance is related to two types of EEG phenomena i a tonic increase in alpha but a decrease in theta power, and ii a large phasic {\v{Z}}. event-related decrease in alpha but increase in theta, depending on the type of memory demands. Because alpha frequency shows large interindividual differences which are related to age and memory performance, this double dissociation between alpha vs. theta and tonic vs. phasic changes can be observed only if fixed frequency bands are abandoned. It is suggested to adjust the frequency windows of alpha and theta for each subject by using individual alpha frequency as an anchor point. Based on this procedure, a consistent interpretation of a {\v{Z}} variety of findings is made possible. As an example, in a similar way as brain volume does, upper alpha power increases but theta power. decreases from early childhood to adulthood, whereas the opposite holds true for the late part of the lifespan. Alpha power is lowered and theta power enhanced in subjects with a variety of different neurological disorders. Furthermore, after sustained wakefulness and during the transition from waking to sleeping when the ability to respond to external stimuli ceases, upper alpha power decreases, whereas {\v{Z}}. theta increases. Event-related changes indicate that the extent of upper alpha desynchronization is positively correlated with semantic long-term memory performance, whereas theta synchronization is positively correlated with the ability to encode new information. The reviewed findings are interpreted on the basis of brain oscillations. It is suggested that the encoding of new information is reflected by {\v{Z}}. theta oscillations in hippocampo-cortical feedback loops, whereas search and retrieval processes in semantic long-term memory are reflected by upper alpha oscillations in thalamo-cortical feedback loops. q},

In one half of the experiment, the task was to discriminate emotional and neutral facial expressions. Here, an enhanced early frontocentral positivity was elicited in response to emotional as opposed to neutral faces, followed by a broadly distributed positivity and an enhanced negativity at lateral posterior sites. These emotional expression effects were very similar for all six basic emotional expressions. In the other half of the experiment, attention was directed away from the faces toward a demanding perceptual discrimination task. Under these conditions, emotional expression effects were completely eliminated, demonstrating that brain processes involved in the detection and analysis of facial expression require focal attention. The face-specific N170 component was unaffected by any emotional expression, supporting the hypothesis that structural encoding and expression analysis are independent processes.},

SPW occur during consummatory behaviors and slow wave sleep. This field potential reflects summated EPSPs in the apical dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons as a result of population synchrony in the CA3 recurrent network. During SPW bursts, CA1 pyramidal cells display highly coherent transient network oscillations (200 Hz). Participating pyramidal cells discharge at a significantly lower rate than the frequency of the population oscillation and their action potentials are phase-locked to the simultaneously recorded oscillatory field potentials. Antagonistic to these intermittent events are the theta (6–10 Hz) and associated gamma (40–100 Hz) oscillations during exploratory behavior and REM sleep. In the intact rat the gamma pattern has its largest amplitude in the hilus, is modulated by theta and is entrained by the entorhinal input. The theta pattern is generated by several spatially distinct but highly coherent dipoles and requires an external pacemaker (septum).},

The rhythm around which the hypothetical resonance is envisaged to be entrained is the hippocampal theta rhythm, the most regular electrographic rhythm in the mammalian brain. As an introduction to the theta rhythm its most obvious behavioural correlates in various species will be described in the present chapter. The approach adopted in the present chapter is somewhat behaviourist in tone, though not in philosophical commitment, for reasons described below.},

abstract = {The ever-growing development of sensor technology has led to the use of multimodal sensors to develop robotics and automation systems. It is therefore highly expected to develop methodologies capable of integrating information from multimodal sensors with the goal of improving the performance of surveillance, diagnosis, prediction, and so on. However, real multimodal data often suffer from significant weak-pairing characteristics, i.e., the full pairing between data samples may not be known, while pairing of a group of samples from one modality to a group of samples in another modality is known. In this paper, we establish a novel projective dictionary learning framework for weakly paired multimodal data fusion. By introducing a latent pairing matrix, we realize the simultaneous dictionary learning and the pairing matrix estimation, and therefore improve the fusion effect. In addition, the kernelized version and the optimization algorithms are also addressed. Extensive experimental validations on some existing data sets are performed to show the advantages of the proposed method.},

In principle, such experiments can be performed in psychology, cognitive, and social sciences. Recently one of such experiments (described in the first version of the preprint) based on recognition of images was performed. It confirms our prediction on quantum-like behaviour of mind. In fact, the general contex-tual probability theory predicts not only quantum-like trigonometric (cos $\theta$) interference of probabilities, but also hyperbolic (cosh $\theta$) interference of probabilities (as well as hyper-trigonometric). In principle , statistical data obtained in experiments with cognitive systems can produce hyperbolic (cosh $\theta$) interference of probabilities. At the moment there are no experimental confirmations of hyperbolic interference for cognitive systems. We introduce a wave function of (e.g., human) population. This function could be reconstructed on the basis of statistical data for two incompatible observables. In general, we should not reject the possibility that cognitive functioning is neither quantum nor classical. We discuss the structure of state spaces for cognitive systems.},

abstract = {As autonomous and semiautonomous systems are developed for automotive, aviation, cyber, robotics and other applications, the ability of human operators to effectively oversee and interact with them when needed poses a significant challenge. An automation conundrum exists in which as more autonomy is added to a system, and its reliability and robustness increase, the lower the situation awareness of human operators and the less likely that they will be able to take over manual control when needed. The human–autonomy systems oversight model integrates several decades of relevant autonomy research on operator situation awareness, out-of-the-loop performance problems, monitoring, and trust, which are all major challenges underlying the automation conundrum. Key design interventions for improving human performance in interacting with autonomous systems are integrated in the model, including human–automation interface features and central automation interaction paradigms comprising levels of automation, adaptiv...},

abstract = {This study examined the influence of automation reliability on task-unrelated mind wandering frequency and the impact of mind wandering on task engagement. Automated environment features make it particularly prone to increase mind wandering frequency. Through mechanisms like complacency or agency, automating a task could increase mind wandering frequency for the operator. For safety-critical industries, the lower perception and degraded stimuli processing associated with mind wandering, summarized by the term “decoupling hypothesis”, are particularly concerning. 16 participants supervised an autopilot avoiding obstacles with two levels of reliability. Each condition lasted 45 minutes. We recorded thoughts as either pertaining to being focused, task-related mind wandering or task-unrelated mind wandering. We also recorded perceived mental demand, trust regarding the autopilot and oculometric measures. Based on questionnaire results, our protocol succeeded in inducing more mental demand and lower trust when the automation was unreliable. Attentional states were not correlated, nor did it influence trust in the system reliability. On the contrary, mental demand ratings and pupil diameter were lower during both task-related and task-unrelated mind wandering, compared to those during the focus attentional state. This shows that perceptual decoupling also affects the engagement of operators in automated environments, which may dramatically lower their ability to supervise automation efficiently. This research informs human-automation designers to consider operator engagement when creating automated systems.},

abstract = {ObjectiveA study was run to test the sensitivity of multiple workload indices to the differing cognitive demands of four military monitoring task scenarios and to investigate relationships between indices. BackgroundVarious psychophysiological indices of mental workload exhibit sensitivity to task factors. However, the psychometric properties of multiple indices, including the extent to which they intercorrelate, have not been adequately investigated. MethodOne hundred fifty participants performed in four task scenarios based on a simulation of unmanned ground vehicle operation. Scenarios required threat detection and/or change detection. Both single- and dual-task scenarios were used. Workload metrics for each scenario were derived from the electroencephalogram (EEG), electrocardiogram, transcranial Doppler sonography, functional near infrared, and eye tracking. Subjective workload was also assessed. ResultsSeveral metrics showed sensitivity to the differing demands of the four scenarios. Eye fixation duration and the Task Load Index metric derived from EEG were diagnostic of single-versus dual-task performance. Several other metrics differentiated the two single tasks but were less effective in differentiating single- from dual-task performance. Psychometric analyses confirmed the reliability of individual metrics but failed to identify any general workload factor. An analysis of difference scores between low- and high-workload conditions suggested an effort factor defined by heart rate variability and frontal cortex oxygenation. ConclusionsGeneral workload is not well defined psychometrically, although various individual metrics may satisfy conventional criteria for workload assessment. ApplicationPractitioners should exercise caution in using multiple metrics that may not correspond well, especially at the level of the individual operator.},

Under certain circumstances, increased psychological stress among VDT operators is seen to create serious problems in their occupations, yet few studies have dealt directly with this problem. It is not clear how this should be measured and evaluated. We report the results of experiments where psychological stress was induced during VDT tasks such as visual search and computer mouse operations. The relationship between spatio-temporal analysis of EEG activity and productivity of VDT work was investigated. The subjects were divided into three age groups: young adults (18–22 years old), middle-aged (38–42 years old) and the elderly (58 years and over). Characteristic EEG changes occurred during VDT tasks. These consisted of frontal midline theta waves with maximum amplitude at Fz. Statistically significant relationships were found between duration of working, EEG electrode location on the head, as well as correlations between work speed and variation of theta waves. It was concluded that some factors relating to the severity of a mental task and the distribution of cortical EEG potentials are closely related. When long lasting theta waves appear in the EEG, a rest period should be considered, before the subjects complain of fatigue. An effective method to optimally determine the duration of work and rest periods can be designed using the EEG.},
