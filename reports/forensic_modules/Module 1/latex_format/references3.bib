abstract = "Animal electrocorticogram (ECoG) studies have shown that spatial patterns in the gamma band (> 20 Hz) reflect perceptual categorization. Spatio-temporal correlations were investigated in the 20–50 Hz range in search for similar phenomena in human ECoG. ECoGs were recorded in a somatosensory discrimination task from 64-electrode subdural grid arrays, with inter-electrode spacing of 1 cm, overlying somatosensory, motor and superior temporal cortices in 2 patients with intractable epilepsy. Bootstrap techniques were devised to analyze the spatial and temporal characteristics of the correlations. Despite an extensive search, no evidence was found for globally correlated activity related to behavior either in narrow (i.e., 35–45 Hz) or broad (i.e., 20–50 Hz) bands. Spatial patterns, extracted using principal component analysis, could not be classified with respect to stimulus type in any time interval. Instead, spatially and temporally intermittent synchronization was observed between pairs of electrodes in 1 cm X 1 cm regions with high variability within and across trials. The distribution of correlation coefficients differed substantially from background levels at inter-electrode distances of 1 em and 1.4 cm but not 2 cm or more. The minimum duration of correlation, the decorrelation time, of the ECoG was about 50 msec; the average correlation duration at 1 cm inter-electrode distance was about 150 msec; and the recurrences rate of significant correlation peaks was about 1.3/sec. The findings suggest that the surface diameters of domains of spatially correlated activity underlying perceptual categorization in human gamma band ECoG are limited to less than 2 cm and that the intermittent synchronization observed across separations of 1 cm and 1.4 cm is not solely due to volume conduction. Thus, if such gamma band spatial patterns exist in the human brain, no existing technology would be capable of measuring them at the scalp, and subdural electrode arrays for cortical surface recording would have to have spacings under 5 mm."

abstract = "Subdural recordings from 8 patients and depth recordings from 3 patients via rows of electrodes with 5–10 mm spacing were searched for signs of significant local differentiation of coherence calculated between all possible pairs of loci. EEG samples of 2–4 min were taken during 4 states: alertness, stage 2–3 sleep, light surgical anesthesia permitting the patient to respond to questions and electrical seizures. Coherence was computed for all frequencies from 1 to 50 Hz or 0.3–100 Hz; for comparisons the mean coherence over each of 6 or 7 narrower bands between 2 and 70 Hz was used. Whereas the literature supports the view that EEG coherence is usually substantial over many centimeters, the hypothesis here tested — and found to be well above stochastic expectations — is that significant structure occurs in the millimeter domain for EEG recorded subdurally or within the brain. In both the subdural surface samples and those from temporal lobe depth electrode arrays coherence declines with distance between electrodes of the pair, on the average quite severely in millimeters. This is nearly the same for all frequency bands. For middle bands like 8–13 and 13–20 Hz, mean coherence typically declines most steeply in the first 10 mm, from values indistinguishable from 1.0 at < 0.5 mm distance to 0.5 at 5–10 mm and to 0.25 in another 10–20 mm in the subdural surface data. Temporal lobe depth estimates decline about half as fast; coherence ≥ 0.5 extends for 9–20 mm and ≥ 0.25 for another 20–35 mm. Low frequency bands (1–5, 5–8 Hz) usually fall slightly more slowly than high frequency bands (20–35, 35–50 Hz) but the difference is small and variance large. The steepness of decline with distance in humans is significantly but only slightly smaller than that we reported earlier for the rabbit and rat, averaging less than one half. Local coherence, for individual pairs of loci, shows differentiation in the millimeter range, i.e., nearest neighbor pairs may be locally well above or below average and this is sustained over minutes. Local highs and lows tend to be similar for widely different frequency bands. Coherence varies quite independently of power, although they are sometimes correlated. Regional differentiation is statistically significant in average coherence among pairs of loci on temporal vs. frontal cortex or lateral frontal vs. subfrontal strips in the same patient, but such differences are usually small. We could not test how consistent they are over hours or between patients. Differences between left and right hemispheres, whether symmetrical pairs or pooled from two or more lobes on each side, can be quite large; in our patients the right side is usually higher, especially in the waking state. Brain state has a large influence. Slow wave sleep usually shows slightly more coherence at each distance, in all bands, compared to the waking EEG, but not consistently. Coherence at a given distance or its rate of decline with distance is a more direct measure of synchrony than naked-eye “synchronization,” which is dominated by the power spectrum. Among the range of EEG states classified as seizures, coherence varies widely but it averages higher by 0.05-0.2 than in pre-ictal states, usually in all frequencies when computed over the whole seizure but much more in the higher bands during the height of the electrical paroxysm. The findings point to still finer structure and more variance with closer spacing of electrodes. They could not predict the known large scale coherence between scalp electrodes, but are not in conflict with them. Scalp recording blurs the finer spatial structure, but reveals macrostructure missed by subdural and depth recording with limited numbers of channels. The strong tendency for correlated fluctuations across frequency bands is contrary to expectation from the common model of independent oscillators."

Human cognition requires the coordination of neural activity across widespread brain networks. Here, we describe a new mechanism for large-scale coordination in the human brain: traveling waves of theta and alpha oscillations. Examining direct brain recordings from neurosurgical patients performing a memory task, we found contiguous clusters of cortex in individual patients with oscillations at specific frequencies within 2 to 15 Hz. These oscillatory clusters displayed spatial phase gradients, indicating that they formed traveling waves that propagated at ∼0.25–0.75 m/s. Traveling waves were relevant behaviorally because their propagation correlated with task events and was more consistent when subjects performed the task well. Human traveling theta and alpha waves can be modeled by a network of coupled oscillators because the direction of wave propagation correlated with the spatial orientation of local frequency gradients. Our findings suggest that oscillations support brain connectivity by organizing neural processes across space and time."

Here, we implemented continuous and simultaneous EEG/fMRI to identify BOLD signal changes related to spontaneous power fluctuations in the alpha rhythm (8–12 Hz), the dominant EEG pattern during relaxed wakefulness. Thirty-two channels of EEG were recorded in 10 subjects during eyes-closed rest inside a 1.5-T magnet resonance (MR) scanner using an MR-compatible EEG recording system. Functional scanning by echoplanar imaging covered almost the entire cerebrum every 4 s. Off-line MRI artifact subtraction software was applied to obtain continuous EEG data during fMRI acquisition. The average alpha power over 1-s epochs was derived at several electrode positions using a Fast Fourier Transform. The power time course was then convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function, down-sampled, and used for statistical parametric mapping of associated signal changes in the image time series. At all electrode positions studied, a strong negative correlation of parietal and frontal cortical activity with alpha power was found. Conversely, only sparse and nonsystematic positive correlation was detected. The relevance of these findings is discussed in view of the current theories on the generation and significance of the alpha rhythm and the related functional neuroimaging findings."

Work has already begun on studying a host of spontaneous EEG phenomena ranging from alpha rhythm and sleep patterns to epileptiform discharges and seizures, with far reaching clinical implications. However, the transformation of EEG data into linear models suitable for voxel-based statistical hypothesis testing is central to the endeavour. This in turn is predicated upon a number of assumptions regarding the manner in which the generators of EEG phenomena may engender changes in the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal. Furthermore, important limitations are posed by a set of considerations quite unique to ‘paradigmless fMRI’. Here, these issues are assembled and explored to provide an overview of progress made and unresolved questions, with an emphasis on applications in epilepsy."

ABSTRACT={Simultaneous electroencephalogram (EEG)-functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) recordings have seen growing application in the evaluation of epilepsy, namely in the characterization of brain networks related to epileptic activity. In EEG-correlated fMRI studies, epileptic events are usually described as boxcar signals based on the timing information retrieved from the EEG, and subsequently convolved with a hemodynamic response function to model the associated Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) changes. Although more flexible approaches may allow a higher degree of complexity for the hemodynamics, the issue of how to model these dynamics based on the EEG remains an open question. In this work, a new methodology for the integration of simultaneous EEG-fMRI data in epilepsy is proposed, which incorporates a transfer function from the EEG to the BOLD signal. Independent component analysis of the EEG is performed, and a number of metrics expressing different models of the EEG-BOLD transfer function are extracted from the resulting time courses. These metrics are then used to predict the fMRI data and to identify brain areas associated with the EEG epileptic activity. The methodology was tested on both ictal and interictal EEG-fMRI recordings from one patient with a hypothalamic hamartoma. When compared to the conventional analysis approach, plausible, consistent, and more significant activations were obtained. Importantly, frequency-weighted EEG metrics yielded superior results than those weighted solely on the EEG power, which comes in agreement with previous literature. Reproducibility, specificity, and sensitivity should be addressed in an extended group of patients in order to further validate the proposed methodology and generalize the presented proof of concept.}

	abstract = {During much of sleep, virtually all cortical neurons undergo a slow oscillation (\&lt;1 Hz) in membrane potential, cycling from a hyperpolarized state of silence to a depolarized state of intense firing. This slow oscillation is the fundamental cellular phenomenon that organizes other sleep rhythms such as spindles and slow waves. Using high-density electroencephalogram recordings in humans, we show here that each cycle of the slow oscillation is a traveling wave. Each wave originates at a definite site and travels over the scalp at an estimated speed of 1.2-7.0 m/sec. Waves originate more frequently in prefrontal-orbitofrontal regions and propagate in an anteroposterior direction. Their rate of occurrence increases progressively reaching almost once per second as sleep deepens. The pattern of origin and propagation of sleep slow oscillations is reproducible across nights and subjects and provides a blueprint of cortical excitability and connectivity. The orderly propagation of correlated activity along connected pathways may play a role in spike timing-dependent synaptic plasticity during sleep.},

ABSTRACT={Previous studies in non-human primates (NHPs) have shown that beta oscillations (15–30 Hz) of local field potentials (LFPs) in the arm/hand areas of primary motor cortex (MI) propagate as traveling waves across the cortex. These waves exhibited two stereotypical features across animals and tasks: (1) The waves propagated in two dominant modal directions roughly 180° apart, and (2) their propagation speed ranged from 10 to 35 cm/s. It is, however, unknown if such cortical waves occur in the human motor cortex. This study shows that the two properties of propagating beta waves are present in MI of a tetraplegic human patient while he was instructed to perform an instruction delay center-out task using a cursor controlled by the chin. Moreover, we show that beta waves are sustained and have similar properties whether the subject was engaged in the task or at rest. The directions of the successive sustained waves both in the human subject and a NHP subject tended to switch from one dominant mode to the other, and at least in the NHP subject the estimated distance traveled between successive waves traveling into and out of the central sulcus is consistent with the hypothesis of wave reflection between the border of motor and somatosensory cortices. Further, we show that the occurrence of the beta waves is not uniquely tied to periods of increased power in the beta frequency band. These results demonstrate that traveling beta waves in MI are a general phenomenon occurring in human as well as NHPs. Consistent with the NHP data, the dominant directions of the beta LFP waves in human aligned to the proximal to distal gradient of joint representations in MI somatotopy. This consistent finding of wave propagation may imply the existence of a hardwired organization of motor cortex that mediates this spatiotemporal pattern.}
